                          <h3>DISCHEM</h3>
  <p>Dis-Chem has private label products, 
      sells via the Internet, operates a loyalty programme, 
      and the Group has a wholesale division. The chain announced in 2016 
      its plans to double the number of outlets through 2021. At that time, 
      one-third of its outlets were less than three years old. 
</p>
   <p> n 2014, Dis-Chem opened its first store outside South Africa, 
       in Windhoek, Namibia. In November 2016, 
       Dis-Chem Pharmacies Limited group listed 27.5% of its listed share
        capital on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. 
        It was the second-largest IPO in the exchange's history.
   </p>
 <p>Dis-Chem started in 1978 when pharmacists Ivan and Lynette Saltzman, opened their first retail pharmacy in Mondeor, a southern suburb of Johannesburg. They introduced the concept of a discount pharmacy with product categories that until then, had not been offered in South African pharmacies because of prohibiting legislation.</p>
